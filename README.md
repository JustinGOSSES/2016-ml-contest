This is a forked repo from the original <a href="https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest">SEG repo</a>. My work is in the Pet Stromatolite <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/2016-ml-contest/tree/master/Pet_Stromatolite">folder</a>. The final scores for the contest can be found <a href="https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest"> here</a>. I got more or less 7th. The ambiguity comes from only the top teams' final models being run many times and a stochastic F1 score used to rank. The rest of the entries were ordered based on a single prediction comparison with the blind wells. This was an open-source contest, so we could see each others work as it was submitted.

## Leaderboard

F1 scores of models against secret blind data in the STUART and CRAWFORD wells. The logs for those wells are available [in the repo](https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest/blob/master/validation_data_nofacies.csv), but contestants do not have access to the facies.

**Please note that after the contest closes, we will be applying a stochastic scoring approach to the leading models. So these scores are subject to change.**

## Getting started with Python

Please refer to the [User guide to the geophysical tutorials](http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle35020190.1) for tips on getting started in Python and find out more about Jupyter notebooks.


## Find out more about the contest

If you intend to enter this contest, I suggest you check [the open issues](https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest/issues) and read through  [the closed issues](https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) too. There's some good info in there.

To find out more please read the article in [the October issue](http://library.seg.org/toc/leedff/35/10) or read the manuscript in the [`tutorials-2016`](https://github.com/seg/tutorials-2016) repo.


## Rules

We've never done anything like this before, so there's a good chance these rules will become clearer as we go. We aim to be fair at all times, and reserve the right to make judgment calls for dealing with unforeseen circumstances.

**IMPORTANT: When this contest was first published, we asked you to hold the SHANKLE well blind. This is no longer necessary. You can use all the published wells in your training. Related: I am removing the file of predicted facies for the STUART and CRAWFORD wells, to reduce confusion — they are not actual facies, only those predicted by Brendon's first model.**

- You must submit your result as code and we must be able to run your code.
- **Entries will be scored by a comparison against known facies in the STUART and CRAWFORD wells, which do not have labels in the contest dataset. We will use the F1 cross-validation score.** See [issue #2 regarding this point](https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest/issues/2). The scores in the 'leaderboard' reflect this.
- Where there is stochastic variance in the predictions, the median average of 100 realizations will be used as the cross-validation score. See [issue #114 regarding this point](https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest/issues/114). The scores in the leaderboard **do not** currently reflect this. Probably only the top entries will be scored in this way. [updated 23 Jan]
- The result we get with your code is the one that counts as your result.
- To make it more likely that we can run it, your code must be written in Python or R or Julia **or Lua** [updated 26 Oct].
- The contest is over at 23:59:59 UT (i.e. midnight in London, UK) on 31 January 2017. Pull requests made aftetr that time won't be eligible for the contest.
- If you can do even better with code you don't wish to share fully, that's really cool, nice work! But you can't enter it for the contest. We invite you to share your result through your blog or other channels... maybe a paper in *The Leading Edge*.
- This document and documents it links to will be the channel for communication of the leading solution and everything else about the contest.
- This document contains the rules. Our decision is final. No purchase necessary. Please exploit artificial intelligence responsibly.
